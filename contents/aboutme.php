                    Hello! My name is Aashish Gurung and I love Coding, for me, it is a way to bring ideas to life and I extensively use JavaScript to create beautiful web applications.
                </p>

                <p>
                    After receiving my bachelor's degree in information technology with a major in web and mobile application development from Victoria University, I was able to obtain an internship as a software developer at<span class="color-lightgreen"> 909IT solutions </span>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I've also developed various internal applications, such as an online bar manual, an online roster for <span class="color-lightgreen">The Spice Room in Sydney </span>, and a website for <span class="color-lightgreen">2BRIDGES in Neutral Bay, NSW </span>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My interest and love for programming have grown in recent years, and the internship has convinced me that Web development is my genuine calling.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here are a few technologies I have been working with recently:<br>
